## Rental Payments
**“Different”** offers a web-based app to the tenants to manage their lease. The **Rental Payments** web app allows tenants
to see a list of their past and upcoming rent payments.

## Intructions
1. Tenants can view the list of their rent payments by entering their 'Lease ID' into the search bar and then pressing either the search button or 'Enter' on the keyboard.
2. Tenants can also press on the tenants button to view a list of all tenants and click on an item on the table to search the selected lease.
